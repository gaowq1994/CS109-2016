This dataset was curated by Chris Piech, but it is based on data originally made for the "Netflix Prize". The Netflix Prize data was initially retracted because of concerns over user privacy. Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, gave the official thumbs up for CS109 to release this anonymized subset of data. Thanks to Matt Chen for his help in getting the Netflix Prize data.
